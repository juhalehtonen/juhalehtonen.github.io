                <p>My previous personal site was built with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> and <a href="https://phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>. While I still love the BEAM ecosystem, it didn&rsquo;t really make much sense to host a completely static website on top of Phoenix (and pay for the associated server costs). I&rsquo;m still very actively working with Phoenix, but for my personal little corner of the web, I wanted to go with something simpler.</p>
<p>After a small time of contemplation, I picked <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. The primary motivator was that I knew I&rsquo;d be running into <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a> at work soon anyway, so choosing to <strong>not</strong> use it allowed me to expand my experiences beyond what I touch at work. I&rsquo;ll be writing about this trail of thought more in the future. I&rsquo;d suggest staying tuned, but you might be tuning in for quite some time.</p>
<p>Having used Jekyll before, Hugo seems sort of familiar right off the gate. However, I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of the documentation and guides the Hugo site offered. I had to spend some time discovering the Hugo features and patterns by myself, as the documentation seemed more geared towards those users who had already familiarized themselves with the tool.</p>
<p>Another piece of technology that I wanted to test out with this site is <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, a new privacy-friendly web analytics service. I didn&rsquo;t want to bother with GDPR (privacy policies, cookie settings and all that), so Plausible was a natural choice. I&rsquo;ve been a big user of Google Analytics at work, but as with the Hugo choice, I try my best to <em>try new things when building stuff for fun</em>. You can even find a link to this site&rsquo;s public analytics at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll write more about my experiences with Hugo and Plausible once I&rsquo;ve spent more time with them.</p>
