      <description>Note: The demo I discuss below was built in 2017, so certain examples might not reflect best practices today. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun little interactive example of Elixir though, so I wanted to write some thoughts about it regardless.
Three years ago I wanted to experiment with the soft real-time capabilities of Elixir and Phoenix. I wanted to build a fun demo that could be easily shared with my friends and co-workers, and which would also illustrate the real-time aspect well.</description>
