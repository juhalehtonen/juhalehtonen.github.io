      <description>What I like most about Elixir is how it offers developers a very stable foundation to build upon, both in terms of technological stability (thanks to BEAM) and in terms of churn. With the release of Elixir 1.9 back in 2019, José Valim noted that Elixir was more or less “done” in terms of major features, and that the focus going forward would be on developer experience, ergonomics and other quality-of-life matters.</description>

      <description>Note: The demo I discuss below was built in 2017, so certain examples do not reflect best practices today. It&amp;rsquo;s still a fun little interactive example of Elixir though, so I wanted to write some thoughts about it regardless.
Three years ago I wanted to experiment with the soft real-time capabilities of Elixir and Phoenix. I wanted to build a fun demo that could be easily shared with my friends and co-workers, and which would also illustrate the real-time aspect well.</description>
