      <description>My previous personal site was built with Elixir and Phoenix. While I love the BEAM ecosystem, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really make much sense to host a completely static website on top of Phoenix (and pay for the associated server costs). I&amp;rsquo;m still very actively working with Phoenix, but for my personal little corner of the web, I wanted to go with something simpler.
Static site generation After some quick contemplation, I picked Hugo.</description>

      <description>TL/DR: You can grab my CV in English and/or Finnish.
Knowing how to take a project from start to finish (and beyond) is one of my key strengths. Given the variety of hats I&amp;rsquo;ve worn during my seven years on the field, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot I can offer every step of the way. With that being said, my recent years have definitely sharpened my focus towards all things technical.
Code &amp;amp; software My primary programming languages of choice are Elixir, JavaScript and PHP.</description>
