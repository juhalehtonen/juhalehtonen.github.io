      <description>My previous personal site was built with Elixir and Phoenix. While I love the BEAM ecosystem, it didn&amp;rsquo;t really make much sense to host a completely static website on top of Phoenix (and pay for the associated server costs). I&amp;rsquo;m still very actively working with Phoenix, but for my personal little corner of the web, I wanted to go with something simpler.
Static site generation After some quick contemplation, I picked Hugo.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Helsinki-based multidisciplinary full stack developer. To put those words into more concrete terms: I primarily build frontends and backends for web-based software, with a slight tendency to lean towards the front side of things. I also manage servers and infrastructure, build development tooling, design user interfaces &amp;amp; perform content audits, and write technical &amp;amp; non-technical texts.
You can grab my CV in English and/or Finnish.
Skills and experience Knowing how to take a project from start to finish (and beyond) is one of my key strengths.</description>
