                <p>I&rsquo;m a Helsinki-based multidisciplinary full stack developer. To put those words into more concrete terms: I primarily build frontends and backends for web-based software, with a slight tendency to lean towards the front side of things. I also manage servers and infrastructure, build development tooling, design user interfaces &amp; perform content audits, and write technical &amp; non-technical texts.</p>

<h2 id="skills-and-experience">Skills and experience</h2>
<p>Knowing how to take a project from start to finish (and beyond) is one of my key strengths. Given the variety of hats I&rsquo;ve worn during my seven years on the field, there&rsquo;s a lot I can offer every step of the way. With that being said, my recent years have definitely sharpened my focus towards all things technical.</p>
<h3 id="code--software">Code &amp; software</h3>
<p>My primary programming languages of choice are Elixir, JavaScript and PHP. While I&rsquo;ve studied a variety of other languages out of sheer curiosity (Elm, Erlang, Clojure, Idris, Rust and Python come to mind), they&rsquo;ve historically been more curiosities than professional tools in my toolbox.</p>
<p>It would be a crime to not mention WordPress, the open source CMS that has paid my bills for all these years. Lastly, I&rsquo;m well versed with modern HTML and CSS (Sass being a particularly preferred flavour) with strong understanding of web accessibility and how to meet WCAG guidelines.</p>
<h3 id="tools--platforms">Tools &amp; platforms</h3>
<p>To manage the hosting of things, I&rsquo;m familiar with infrastructure automation tools such as Ansible and Terraform, build systems such as CircleCI, TravisCI, GitHub Actions and Bitbucket Pipelines, and web server software Nginx and Apache. I also have a grasp of both AWS and Heroku ecosystems, and have run a bunch of web services on both.</p>
<p>After spending roughly a year as a dedicated Analytics Developer, I acquired a fairly decent grasp of Google&rsquo;s web analytics and SEO products. In addition to the non-software part of planning and analyzing data, I got my hands dirty with Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Google Data Studio and Google Search Console.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also played around with Google Colab when building personal machine learning projects, such as a FastAI- and Python-powered bot to detect and inform us when there&rsquo;s coffee available in the office kitchen.</p>
<h3 id="design--communication">Design &amp; communication</h3>
<p>On the design front, my tools of the trade include Photoshop, Sketch and Figma. When I&rsquo;m sketching up new concepts, I tend to prefer the use of good old pen &amp; paper over more modern technology, as I feel this allows for more rapid ideation and more frictionless collaboration with other stakeholders.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also familiar with a variety of UX design methodologies, and I like to combine these with the low-friction sketching for best results. I&rsquo;m also a big fan of in-browser prototyping, because it allows all stakeholders to get a feel for the real thing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m not busy with all the above, I do also perform copywriting work every now and again. This includes identifying the goals and values of the company, establishing a tone of voice for the brand, and collaborating with stakeholders to produce text that is uniquely theirs.</p>
